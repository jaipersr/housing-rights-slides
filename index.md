NYC property taxes are _inequitable_

---

and **_regressive_**

---

as tax burdens get shifted

---

...from _landlords_ in fast growing neighborhoods

---

...onto _tenants_ in low income communities

---

Decreasing _affordability_

---

Increasing _precarity_

---


**_What happened?_**

---

_S7000A_

---

Passed in **_1981_**, this law created our current four class tax system.

---

  1. small residential
  2. large residential
  3. utility
  4. commercial

---

_How property taxes are calculated:_

---

1. the city estimates _market value_

---

_caveat:_ co-ops and condos are estimated from nearby buildings

---

...many of which are rent controlled

---

meaning they are **_undervalued_** for tax purposes

---

2. the market value is multiplied by a ratio based on tax class

---

_6%_ 
</br>
<small class="nobreak">for small residential</small>
</br>
</br>
_45%_ 
</br>
<small class="nobreak">for all other classes</small>


---

to get the _assessed value_

---

**_but!_**

---

3. how much the assessed value increases per year is _capped_

---

meaning if neighborhood property values _appreciate quickly_

---

...these new high value properties are **_undervalued_** for tax purposes!

---

4. the class tax rate is applied based on class share

---

2017/2018

  1. small residential (20.919%)
  2. large residential (12.612%)
  3. utility (12.093%)
  4. commercial (10.514%)

---

The class share system was originally instituted in the 80s

---

...to insure that each class bore a similar amount of _tax burden_

---

However, the market moves faster than legislation

---

Class 1 property values have _increased far faster than their class share_.

---

...resulting in a _65% lower tax burden_, which is shifted onto the other property classes

---

5. exemptions and abatements are applied

---

...further reducing or even eliminating property taxes

--- 

_421a_ provides tax exemptions for developing new affordable housing

---

_j51_ provides tax abatements for <small class="nobreak">_planned renovations_</small>

---

However, these abatement claims have poor oversight

---

...and are often claimed _without meeting the requirements_.

---

...in places already unaffordable

---


_Cooperative & Condominum Tax Abatement_

---

furthur benefits residents of </br>co-ops & condos

---

The abatements, which _subtract directly from the city's tax revenue_

---

...serve to subsidize developers & landlords

---

and if the city's required property tax revenue is increasing

---

_(it is)_

---

who is bearing the cost?

---

_(tenants)_

---

# What is to be done?

---

Reform
</br>
through state legislature has been _ineffective_

---

Our goal is to
* <small class="nobreak">help pursue _legal_ action</small>
* <small class="nobreak">inspire _local_ organizing</small>

---

...against the opaque idea of a _broken tax system_

---

and to do that we need to create _compelling visualizations_

---

not just provide `technical details`
